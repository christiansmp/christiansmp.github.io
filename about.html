          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              The internet is filled with communities, but so few of them are oriented toward
              the glory of God. We saw an opportunity to create something different: a Minecraft
              community where believers could gather not just to play, but to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Christian SMP exists because we believe that fellowship matters, even in digital
              spaces. We believe that creativity is a gift from God, and that building together
              can be an act of worship. We believe that the body of Christ extends beyond
              physical church walls into every corner of our lives, including our recreation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not an escape from the world but a gathering of pilgrims who carry the
              light of Christ wherever they go. We are here to encourage one another, to speak
              truth in love, and to point each other toward the hope we have in Jesus.

          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              <strong>Christ is the head of this community, not any personality, not clout, not power.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We reject the tendency of online communities to form around charismatic leaders
              or to become platforms for personal brands. Our allegiance is to Jesus Christ alone,
              and our goal is to point every member toward Him.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that no one is above correction. No one is too important to serve.
              And no one is too small to matter. In Christ, we are all brothers and sisters,
              and we treat one another accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              When decisions are made, they are made prayerfully and according to Scripture.
              When conflicts arise, they are handled with grace and truth. When we gather,
              we gather as the body of Christ, each member valued and needed.

          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              Minecraft is not merely a game to us. It is a canvas for the creative impulse
              that God placed within every human heart. When we build, we imitate our Creator.
              When we design, we reflect His beauty. When we collaborate, we embody the unity
              of the body of Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
              We approach building with intention and excellence, not because we seek the
              praise of others, but because we believe that offering our best is an act of
              worship. A cathedral built in Minecraft can glorify God just as one built of stone,
              if the heart behind it is oriented toward Him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, creativity is stewardship. The time, talent, and imagination we invest
              are gifts from God, and we use them for His glory and the encouragement of
              our brothers and sisters.
